# Design-of-Low-Noise-Amplifier-for-WLAN-IEEE-802.11ax-Standard

The receiver's sensitivity can be increased by using a low noise amplifier (LNA), which is able to effectively amplify low radio frequency signals while diminishing overall system noise. The circuit features three stages, of which the first two stages are for minimum noise amplification and the final stage is for maximum gain amplification wide-band amplifier is developed and simulated using Agilent's ADS, and the amplifying stage makes use of the common source topology to enhance gain and achieve greater isolation. For the purpose of increasing the stability of the circuit through the influence of impedance matching, small micro-strip lines are added to the source tone in this design. To minimize the noise figure, traditional source inductive degeneration is used. The developed circuit is subsequently analyzed and simulated. It illustrates that the gain is between 29 dB and 31 dB between 5.9 GHz and 7.1 GHz (6 GHz center frequency), the noise figure is less than 1.5 dB, and the input and output reflection coefficients are less than -15 dB.
